# BoxCopDotNET
Inspired from the static analyzer tool FxCop from Microsoft, this tool does similar analysis of the submitted dotnet assemblies with corresponding PDB files. 
The tool reports all the usage of the Boxing operation in the assemblies along with the line and column in the code. 
At times, the boxing operation could become a headache in improving performance of an application. Hence this tool could become handy in such a scenario.

This project was concieved as a hobby. Hence a great deal of improvement could be carried over it.
